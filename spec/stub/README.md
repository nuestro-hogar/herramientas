# Stub directory

This directory contains the stub of modules that interacts directly 
with the outside world (mainly Gnome Shell) and therefore testing this
interaction is either not feasible or not useful (e.g. would test 3rd-party code).

Files in this directory should come before the extension's source code in the file search path.
This would allow overriding of modules.
